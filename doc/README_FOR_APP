How Schemer generates models:
Schemer uses scheme records as a dictionary to generate scaffolds from. Schemes describe a
model and all of its attributes.
The following properties of a scheme (model) can be defined:
  relationships - an array of other models that are related to the model, including the 
  name of the related model and the relationship_type
  columns - an array of each attribute of the model  
To create a scheme record, go to schemes/new and either upload a JSON file or fill out the
form. 
If uploading a JSON file, use the syntax in the examples/address_scaffold.json.
